## Writeup

### Step 1: SHA256 of the MSI

From the same malware analysis, obtain the **SHA256** hash of the MSI (or dropped executable), e.g.:

```
88faf43e563acf0628487f6a36e9ab4ee2b9b470dd70461ce34cacecc005cb43
```

### Step 2: Searching for the Original Filename

- Search this hash on **VirusTotal** and check the “File names” / “Detection” or similar tab for the original filename.
- Alternatively use **Any.Run**:  
  [https://any.run/report/88faf43e563acf0628487f6a36e9ab4ee2b9b470dd70461ce34cacecc005cb43/...](https://any.run/report/88faf43e563acf0628487f6a36e9ab4ee2b9b470dd70461ce34cacecc005cb43/aba69a66-93d5-4cfb-bd83-e9149e221677)

### Step 3: Submitting the Correct Name

Common results may include names like `51.brr.msi` or `51.brr`. Submit the **original name including extension** that the platform accepts.
