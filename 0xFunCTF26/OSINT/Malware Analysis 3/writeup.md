### Step 1: SHA256 of the MSI

From the same malware analysis, obtain the **SHA256** hash of the MSI (or dropped executable):

```

```

### Step 2: Searching for the Original Filename

Search this hash on **VirusTotal** and check the "File names" / "Detection" tab for the original filename.

Alternatively use **Any.Run**:
