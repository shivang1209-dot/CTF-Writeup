## Writeup

### Step 1: Recognizing the Notation

The challenge refers to notation used in linguistics and phonetic transcription. That notation is **IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)** or a related phonetic/sheet-music style representation.

### Step 2: Interpreting the Symbols

The provided sequence (e.g. `[1] u [3] m n [6] [7] p h e r`) uses numbers in brackets and letters. These can map to IPA symbols, syllable positions, or stress markers.

### Step 3: Decoding to Text

By interpreting the notation (e.g. numbers as vowel/stress or specific IPA values), we decode the sequence into readable text that forms (or contains) the flag.

### Step 4: Formatting the Flag

Embed the decoded result into the required flag format `0xfun{...}`.
