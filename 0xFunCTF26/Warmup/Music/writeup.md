## Writeup

### Step 1: Recognizing the Notation

The challenge refers to notation used in linguistics and phonetic transcription. The symbols (letters and numbers in brackets) correspond to the **Bucking Music Cipher** (also known as the Music cipher), used in phonetic and language contexts.

### Step 2: Interpreting the Sequence

From the challenge or decoding steps, we obtain a sequence such as:

```
[1] u [3] [4] i n g [8] [9] p h e r
```

Here, bracketed numbers and letters map to cipher elements in the Bucking Music Cipher.

### Step 3: Decoding with the Bucking Music Cipher

Apply the **Bucking Music Cipher** decoding (see [Music cipher – Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_cipher)) to the sequence to get the plaintext.

### Step 4: Formatting the Flag

Embed the decoded result into the required flag format `0xfun{...}`.
