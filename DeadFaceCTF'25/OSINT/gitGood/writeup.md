## **Challenge Name: gitGood**

### **Description**

We know that at least one DEADFACE member has a GitHub account. Find the account associated with that DEADFACE member.

### **Approach**

1. **Initial Investigation**  
   - Attempted to enumerate various usernames that might be associated with DEADFACE members
   - Found a profile with username `syntaxx`, but it didn't have the required @deadface.io email address

2. **Searching GitHub**  
   - Performed a comprehensive search on GitHub for DEADFACE-related accounts
   - Searched for variations of "DEADFACE" and related terms

3. **Finding the Correct Profile**  
   - Located the GitHub profile: `https://github.com/mirveal-deadface`
   - Verified that the profile prominently displays an @deadface.io email address
   - This confirmed it was the correct DEADFACE member account
