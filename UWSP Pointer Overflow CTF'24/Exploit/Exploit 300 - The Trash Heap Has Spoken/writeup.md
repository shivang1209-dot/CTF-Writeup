### **Challenge Name: Exploit 300 - The Trash Heap Has Spoken**

---

### **Description**

The title of this challenge is a reference to an old TV show. Most participants in this contest are probably a little too young to know it, but that's ok. To be honest, I've never really been one for nostalgia. The show was brilliant for my young self and I remember it fondly, but all things have their time and place. I've always felt bringing old things back from the past just made it feel all the more unremarkable. Like a pale imitation of itself. It doesn't help that far too often nostalgia trips, comebacks, and reboots are little more than cynical cash grabs these days. Once things are done - let them be done, I say.

On a not completely unrelated note, there is another item from my youth that seems to be ready for a comeback. Oregon Trail. When I was a kid I used to play for hours. Today, with the popularity of open-world survival games, I'd say it's time for an Oregon Trail reboot. In fact, I think I'll work on it myself and make a mint. Here's my first prototype. It's got a long way to go, obviously, but it's never too early to get feedback. One thing I can be sure of - it is 100% secure.

Your target is 34.123.210.162 on port 32017
