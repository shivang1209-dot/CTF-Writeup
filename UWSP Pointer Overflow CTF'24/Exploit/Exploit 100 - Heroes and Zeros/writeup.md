### **Challenge Name: Exploit 100 - Heroes and Zeros**

---

### **Description**

The Professor needs to power up before the evil Raucus Ruckus invades Earth with his army of slimeballs! To prepare, he needs 10,000 power points. If you don't help him in time, Earth is doomed. Thankfully, you can save your progress and return later to finish.

#### **Target**  
`35.184.182.18 32002`

### **Approach**

#### **Step 1: Running the Binary**
Upon executing the binary, a game interface appears where clicking on a moving diamond grants one power point. Accumulating 10,000 points to unlock the flag manually is impractical.

#### **Step 2: Using Reverse Engineering**
While exploring automated options, opened the binary in **Ghidra** for analysis to inspect the code structure.

#### **Step 3: Searching for Plaintext**
Meanwhile, ran the `strings` command to check if the flag was stored in plaintext:

```bash
strings ./Exploit100-2 | grep -a "poctf{.*}"
```

#### **Step 4: Obtaining the Flag**
The `strings` command revealed the flag directly, confirming it was embedded as plaintext in the binary. No further exploitation was necessary.
