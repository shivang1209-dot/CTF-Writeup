## **Challenge Name: Crack 100 - Hunter Too**

### **Description**

A simple archive with the flag inside. The password is not on a common wordlist, but it can be brute-forced. That should keep you busy for a while. That's it... It's that simple.  

Ok, I admit it. I'm being petty. I'm going to make you work way too hard for 100 points. I have my reasons.  

After five years of running the contest, I've decided to retire the crack category after this year. Every year it's the same thing. Just constant *"lol pay2win"* no matter how much you try to spice them up. Did you see how close I came to a nervous breakdown over the crack challenges earlier this year?  

Nothing I do is good enough. Throw in hints? *lol pay2win.* Leave a trail of breadcrumbs? *lol pay2win.* Literally give the answer in a cheeky sort of way? *lol pay2win.*  

Well, here's your *lol pay2win* challenge for the contest.

### **Approach**

1. **Initial Observations**  
   - The description hinted heavily at the phrase *"lol pay2win."*  
   - Explored various interpretations, including references to *League of Legends*, *Pay2Win* skins, and related variations.  

2. **Realization**  
   - After an extensive search, discovered that the password itself was the exact phrase: `lol pay2win`.

3. **Extracting the Flag**  
   - Entered the password to unlock the archive and retrieved the flag. Felt like an idiot for a minute there.
