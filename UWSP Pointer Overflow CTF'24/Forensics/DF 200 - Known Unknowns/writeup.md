### **Challenge Name: DF 200 - Known Unknowns**

---

### **Description**

So, I was laying in an open field with my super sensitive directional mic, trying to listen to stars like I do every Saturday night. You know, normal stuff. It was going fine and I was jamming out to the sounds of Saturn when I hear this sound coming through. I'm guessing it's the sound of swamp gas reflecting off Jupiter.

#### **File Provided**  
- [DF200-2.wav](Resources/DF200-2.wav)

### **Approach**

#### **Step 1: Initial Analysis**
1. Downloaded the file and confirmed it was a `.wav` audio file.
2. Played the file using Audacity to listen for any audible clues, but found nothing of interest.

#### **Step 2: Spectrogram Analysis**
1. Switched to the spectrogram view in Audacity.
2. Observed the hidden message visually encoded in the audio's `spectrogram`.
