A [website](https://africa.cgtn.com/somalia-president-makes-first-international-state-visit-to-turkey/) with the exact image about this visit mentions that `Farmaajo also visited Turkey’s Parliament building`. This building is also known as `The Grand National Assembly`.

### **Step 2: Verifying the Location**

Further research revealed another statement: `President Erdogan warmly welcomed his Somali counterpart to the presidential palace`.

We searched for `Turkey presidential palace handshake area` and found a [website](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/oct/29/turkeys-new-presidential-palace-unveiled-in-pictures) with images of the Presidential Palace.

After additional analysis, we found the coordinates: `39.9308873, 32.7990765`.

By cross-referencing other images taken at the same location, we confirm the exact coordinates as:

`39°55'52.06"N, 32°47'59.00"E`

## **Final Answers**
