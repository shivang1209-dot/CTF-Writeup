2. **Image Analysis**  
   - Examined the photograph carefully for identifying features
   - Looked for:
     - Reflected text or signs (said George Mason University)
     - Visible buildings and landmarks
     - Geographic features
     - Unique architectural elements

3. **Finding Clues**

   - Identified various building names through trial:
     - `pctf{George_Mason_University}`
     - `pctf{Finley_Building}`
     - `pctf{Thompson_Hall}`
     - `pctf{Horizon_Hall}`

4. **Identifying the Correct Building**  
   - After multiple attempts, identified the correct building
   - The building from which the photo was taken is: **Krug Hall**
