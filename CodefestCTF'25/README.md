# CodefestCTF 2025 Challenge Writeups

Welcome to my repository for the CodefestCTF 2025 writeups!  
This CTF was organized by **IIT BHU** (Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University), and I mainly focused on solving the **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** & **Forensic** challenges. 

## Repo Structure

This repository contains the writeups for **9 OSINT challenges** I attempted during the CodefestCTF 2025 competition. Each challenge has its own folder, and inside each folder, you will find:
- A **writeup** in markdown format explaining how the challenge was solved.
- Any relevant **images** and **resources** used during the investigation.
- **Flag(s)** found from the challenge.
