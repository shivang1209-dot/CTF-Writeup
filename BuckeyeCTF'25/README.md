# BuckeyeCTF 2025 Writeups

Welcome to my repository for the BuckeyeCTF 2025 writeups!  
This CTF was organized by **OSU (Ohio State University)**, and I participated in solving challenges across multiple categories.

## Repo Structure

This repository contains the writeups for **challenges** I attempted during the BuckeyeCTF 2025 competition. Each challenge has its own folder organized by category, and inside each folder, you will find:
